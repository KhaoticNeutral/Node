/*we know now that use strict just allows for easier 
read code and just making sure nothing essentially bugs 
out, it also just keeps consistancy, in this test we're 
passing information back and forth

line 2 exports. works in tangem with require(), we use 
exports. to share functions, objects and their refrences
from one file to another, and we can import then into other
files by using the require() method, its a way to pass things 
back and forth essentially

line rest- a collection of strings to print on the screen 
to demonstarte how to pass files back and forth */
